About
-----

This script make it possible to run large behaviorspace experiments on MPI clusters.  It relies on a significant amount of code from the project forked from ahrenberg/split_nlogo_experiment.  However this approach does not create an xml file per behaviorspace combination making it much more scalable as the file systems tend to get bogged down with 1000s of files in a directory.  

Requirements
------------

This software required an MPI enabled cluster with some version of mpirun.  It has been tested with openmpi.  It also requires python 2.7 or higher with the mpi4py library installed.  Talk to your system administrator if this is not the case.
